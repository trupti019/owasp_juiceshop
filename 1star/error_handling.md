#Title: Error Handling
#Category: Security Misconfiguration

Here, i provoked an error that reveals backend details due to improper error handling or nonsystematic erroe handling.

I followed these steps:

   1.Experiment with URL Paths: Accessed various non-existent or restricted URL paths on the application's server to trigger error responses.
   2.Carefully examined the error messages for any signs of verbose or detailed information leakage.
   3. entered a random name after i forwarded the request to the repeater which triggered the error
