#Title: Repetitive Registration
#Category: Improper Input Validation

 specifically focusses on the handling of password confirmation fields.

 the challenge hint suggests exploiting the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, which in this context implies that the system should not rely on redundant user input to function correctly. 

here i repeated the password string in the first password field and still i have been registered as a user.
