This repository contains my personal walkthrough and notes while hacking the OWASP Juice Shop â€” one of the most vulnerable (and fun) web apps intentionally built for practicing web security.

##  What is Juice Shop?

[OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) is an intentionally insecure web app for learning and practicing modern web vulnerabilities. It covers everything from basic flaws to OWASP Top 10 and beyond â€” all wrapped in a gamified, CTF-style interface.

- Security misconfigurations & sensitive data exposure
- Business logic flaws
- CSP, CORS, and other client-side attacks

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Burp Suite (Community Edition)
- Browser DevTools
- Mindmaps (for attack paths)
